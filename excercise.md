##Exercise: ft_binary_search
Allowed functions : None

Generate a Binary Search function in C ++ programming language. The function must be able to search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The function should return the index of the element if present in the array or return -1 if the element is not present.

Your function's prototype should look like this:

`int ft_binary_search(int arr[], int l, int r, int x);`

where:
- `arr[]` is the array
- `l` is the left-most index of the array
- `r` is the right-most index of the array
- `x` is the target value you are looking for in the array.
